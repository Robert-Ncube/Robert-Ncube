# ROBERT NCUBE

**'Digital Craftsman(Developer/Musician/Actor/Writer)'**

I'm a multi-talented front-end developer passionate about code, beats, words, and the spotlight. I thrive on turning coffee into code. Whether it’s React, JavaScript, or a dash of HTML/CSS, I’m all about building sleek projects from the ground up and solving real-world problems. My commits? As frequent as my coffee refills. When I’m not pushing pixels, I’m dropping bars. Hip-hop is my heartbeat, and my rhymes flow smoother than a well-optimized API call. My GitHub repo? It’s my mixtape—fork, remix, and vibe with it. Words are my playground. From READMEs to poetry, I craft narratives that captivate humans and compilers. Life’s a stage, and I’m the lead in my script. Whether it’s debugging bugs or rehearsing lines, I bring my A-game. My pull requests? They’re my auditions—each one a chance to steal the show.
